# Array Manipulation and User Profile Creation

This project contains three tasks in JavaScript:

## Task 1: Array Manipulation

### arrayManipulation.js

This file contains a function `processArray` that takes an array of numbers and returns a new array where each even number is squared and each odd number is tripled.


## Task 2: Format Array Strings

### arrayManipulation.js

In the same file, a new function `formatArrayStrings` is added. This function takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by `processArray`. The function modifies each string based on its corresponding number: capitalizes the entire string if the number is even and converts the string to lowercase if the number is odd.


## Task 3: User Profile Creation

### userInfo.js

This file contains a function `createUserProfiles` that takes an array of names and the array of modified names from Task 2. The function returns an array of objects, each containing `originalName`, `modifiedName`, and `id` (auto-incremented starting from 1).
